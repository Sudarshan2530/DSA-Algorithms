Hint
Check multiples of 3, 5 and 15.

Short Explanation
For first N natural numbers multiples of 3 are termed as "Fizz", multiples of 5 are termed as "Buzz", while multiples of 15 are termed as "FizzBuzz". Rest all numbers remain in their original form.
Detailed Explanation
All natural numbers divisible by 3 and not by 5 are called as "Fizz" while those divisible by 5 and not by 3 are called as "Buzz". If any number is divisible by both it's called as "FizzBuzz". Rest all natural numbers remain in their original form.

Hence iterating over all natural numbers from 1 to N and, checking whether the ith number ( 1 <= i <= N ) is divisible by 3 or, 5 or, both will fetch the result accordingly.
