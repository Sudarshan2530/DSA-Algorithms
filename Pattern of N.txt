Pattern of N Ended
Description

You are given a number stored in a variable with the nameN

You have to print all the numbers in the range from1 to N*N, such that there are exactlyNnumbers on each line

For example, if the value stored inN = 3, then all the numbers in the range, from [1,9] need to be printed, such that there are 3 numbers on each line. Therefore, the required output is

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Input
The first and the only line of the input contains the value stored in the variableN


Output
Print all the numbers in the range from [1, N*N], as shown in the problem statement, such that there areNnumbers on each line


Sample Input 1 				Sample Output 1
4					1 2 3 4 
					5 6 7 8 
					9 10 11 12 
					13 14 15 16

Solution



import java.util.*;

public class Main{
    public static void patternOfN(int N){
        String s = "";
        int count=0;
        
        for(int i=1; i<=N*N; i++){
            s += i+" ";
            count++;
            if(count==N)
            {
                
                System.out.println(s);
                count = 0;
                s = "";
            }
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        int N = input.nextInt();
        
        patternOfN(N);
        
    }
}
